# Cryptocurrencies
#### *Cryptos analysis using unsupervised machine learning and Python*

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze a dataset from many alternative cryptocurrencies to spot trends that make a firm or person want to invest in them. The problem with cryptos is that the most common ones, like bitcoin or ethereum, are becoming unaffordable for the common public. That being said, I will be using *unsupervised machine learning* to see if we can spot any trends that result in opportunities of these altcoins.
